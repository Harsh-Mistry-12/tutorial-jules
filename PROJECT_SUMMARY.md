## 💬 About the Comments

The project contains **extensive comments** throughout all files:

### Necessary Comments ✅
- Explain Django-specific concepts
- Document important configuration
- Clarify complex logic
- Mark required fields/settings

### Unnecessary Comments 😄
- State obvious things
- Over-explain simple concepts
- Multiple comments for same thing
- Comments about comments!

**Examples:**
```python
# This is a comment
# Another comment
# Yet another comment
```

```css
/* This is the main CSS file */
/* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets */
/* It makes HTML look pretty */
```

```html
<!-- This is the home page template -->
<!-- It uses HTML, which is a markup language -->
<!-- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language -->
```
